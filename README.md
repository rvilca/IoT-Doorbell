# IoT-Doorbell
While working at the Queens College Makerspace, I programmed and designed a smart doorbell that alerts the Makerspace Slack channel that someone is at the door. I iterated my design across three circuits, each using a different programming language (Python, MicroPython, CircuitPython) running on a different microcontroller (Raspberry Pi 3, HUZZAH ESP8266, Feather M4 Express). [Here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNlvpRtvG0Yi65FGugQu5h-fiulHxdqTFkJ2R7pIWbHD4IDjsMpqEyK_gvOTQMajg?key=Q2pOMlZNaVpwTnNraVQwb3RrbDhYZ3pOZmtwczZ3) is a link to images of the soldered circuit using the HUZZAH ESP8266.
